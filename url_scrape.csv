How do deep learning models predict old and new drugs that are successfully treated in healthcare?,"Understanding exactly how data is ingested, analyzed, and returned to the end-user can have a big impact on expectations for accuracy and reliability, not to mention influencing any investments necessary to whip an organization’s data assets into shape. To efficiently and effectively choose between vendor products or hire the right data science staff to develop algorithms in-house, healthcare organizations should feel confident that they have a firm grasp on the different flavors of artificial intelligence and how they can apply to specific use cases. Deep learning is a good place to start.  This branch of artificial intelligence has very quickly become transformative for healthcare, offering the ability to analyze data with a speed and precision never seen before. Deep learning, also known as hierarchical learning or deep structured learning, is a type of machine learning that uses a layered algorithmic architecture to analyze data. In deep learning models, data is filtered through a cascade of multiple layers, with each successive layer using the output from the previous one to inform its results. Deep learning models can become more and more accurate as they process more data, essentially learning from previous results to refine their ability to make correlations and connections. Deep learning is loosely based on the way biological neurons connect to process information in the brains of animals.  Similar to the way electrical signals travel across the cells of living creates, each subsequent layer of nodes is activated when it receives stimuli from its neighboring neurons. In artificial neural networks (ANNs), the basis for deep learning models, each layer may be assigned a specific portion of a transformation task, and data might traverse the layers multiple times to refine and optimize the ultimate output.  These “hidden” layers serve to perform the mathematical translation tasks that turn raw input into meaningful output. With the crypto anchors and blockchain employed with the medicine for example each pill of medication will be printed with scannable details which contains the time of production, originality, etc, which can be printed in medicine using edible substances. Once the medicine is shipped all over the world we can scan the medicine with a scanner and find out whether the medicine is original or counterfeit with the blockchain details stored at the time of manufacturing. By using deep learning in medicines these neural networks will make sense of all the unrelated data and make them into understandable and scalable data so that can be used for making the medicine efficiency better by analyzing molecules of each component used in the medicine."
How artificial intelligence can boost your productivity level?,"So, what we have understood is AI has penetrated our day-to-day life. Now the question is how people can use it in the best possible way to extract value from it and boost their productivity even further? Here are some of my suggestions:"
How are genetic sequencing maps affected by deep learning and AI?,"Even though the use of AI and deep learning can solve many problems related to genomic data, the use is challenging and not cost-effective at all. It needs high-quality machines and skilled experts. But as it was said that – ” If it’s worth it then it’s nothing to worry about.” But if we succeed in applying the concept of deep learning and AI in genetics with cost-effectiveness it will create a history in the world of science and biology and it is possible that humans can reach new heights of genetics and the human genome."
How is AI used to solve traffic management?,"Traffic congestion prediction is getting more attention from the last few decades. With the development of infrastructure, every country is facing a traffic congestion problem. The development of artificial intelligence and the availability of big data have led researchers to apply different models in this field. Deep learning algorithms became more popular with time as they can assess a large data set. However, a wide range of machine learning algorithms is yet to be applied. Therefore, a vast opportunity for research in the field of traffic congestion prediction still prevails. The power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillment that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems."
Benefits of Big Data in Different fields,"According to statistics, digital transformation, technological advancements, and breakthroughs continue to be the primary drivers of the rising amount of big data.  Big data is already enormous, but it is anticipated to rise exponentially as new technologies emerge, such as more widespread IoT devices, drones, and wearables, and computing devices increase. Around Ninety percent of the world’s big data has been created in the previous two to three years. With the enormous bulk of raw data; businesses and industries require proper analysis of those unstructured data sources to draw more insights by effectively and efficiently converting them into useful information. Modernization coupled up with rapid industrialization has put much pressure on data culture and mining, hence paving the way to complex analytical tools to culture and introspect data thereby extracting out the essence out it, those recent advancements in deep learning are also helping businesses decipher this valuable trove of information. Big data and business analytics solutions have become mainstream technologies, and they, together with AI and automation, provide the foundation for the digital transformation process."

Hence, the e-learning portals can use robots or AI to implant this in the learning process to make it wholesome."
How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of Large Firms?,
"Future of Work: Robot, AI and Automation","Even though a technological revolution can lead to wiping out of a mass number of jobs it will create more new job opportunities. Some jobs and sectors are going to witness historical growth in the future. Recent studies show that analytical thinking, creativity, and flexibility are among the top skills needed over the next five years, while data and artificial intelligence, content creation, and cloud computing are the top emerging professions. It will also increase the efficiency of employees thus creating more profit. For example, email marketing is now one of the most efficient ways of marketing where the employer can automatically analyze the effectiveness of campaigns. A technological revolution can also create a revolution in manufacturing which is the “quintessential escalator for developing economies”. Like any other new technology, artificial intelligence and robotics will initially be met with skepticism but eventually being embraced. Technological or robotics revolution will be a milestone in human history which will lead to the creation of more opportunities and a better future for millions."
How AI will help the Defense Power of a country?,"However, there is a concern that applies to all sectors using AI: Will AI replace humans? Will it rule us? The answer is yes if we use too much AI. The same applies in the defense sector also. The applications that have been discussed here act as force multipliers as long as humans control them. AI should never replace soldiers, but perform tasks that are too risky or impossible for humans. AI should not be allowed to become too intelligent nor they should be allowed to operate independently. Machine learning should be confined only to familiarize with battlefield situations, not to think ahead of us and act arbitrarily. Before such a device fires a bullet on its own, a human must be there to see that it happens according to his will. Another concern is hacking. What if the enemy hacks these devices? Such concerns must be addressed by adding multiple layers of encryption or limiting the amount of communication possible. Take, for example, a regular ‘nonsmart’ washing machine. We cannot communicate with it in any other way other than pressing its buttons. Nor can it do anything else other than washing clothes. This could be done with all the unmanned vehicles. Communication must be restricted to the user and the machine. The device should perform only its intended duty. If a nation learns to harness and balance the use of technology, then not only its defense sector but also all the other sectors will be stronger and ensure the nation’s holistic development."
Future of AI and Machine Roles in the Medical Sector,"Many would say that at the end of the day AI is just manmade creation, there will be some flaw in it, we can’t fully trust them, there can be any glitch in it, or what doctor can do AI will never be able to do. In the modern world with the existence of a pandemic situation, AI will be never able to take the place of a doctor but with the assistance of AI, a doctor will able to handle the situation more efficiently and with up gradation in modern technology, they will be well prepared of a situation like covid-19, hope it will never come in future. At last, AI will usher in a new era of mankind and exciting breakthroughs in the human world, since today AI and machine play a very important role in every human’s life, nowadays it is becoming as important as water for living."
AI in healthcare to Improve Patient Outcomes,"Considering the vast range of tasks that an AI can do, it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. Using sophisticated algorithms AI can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. Even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises, ethical measures, training physicians to use it, standard regulations etc, the role of AI in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the integration of AI in daily practice. All of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective."
What if the Creation is Taking Over the Creator?,
What Jobs Will Robots Take From Humans in The Future?,"There have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. With excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. In countries like Japan, mainly computer programs and AI is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. From cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by AI. However, AI cannot replace humans in the future. Humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. These capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. For example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. A machine’s touch would not be able to soothe a child. Another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. Like computers, AI will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. Without humans themselves, there is no future for AI."
Will Machine Replace The Human in the Future of Work?,
Will AI Replace Us or Work With Us?,"So, will machines be able to take over many of our jobs? The answer is a resounding yes. However, for every job that is taken over by robots, there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do. Some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature. Others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships, assisting each other in doing what they do best. In the future, people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for. "

How to protect future data and its privacy?,"If you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account. If you’re diligent about backing up your data and use a secure cloud storage service to do so, you’re headed in the right direction. That said, cloud backups, and any data backups really, create an added step when it comes to deleting old information. Don’t forget to delete files from your backup services in addition to those you remove (or overwrite) on your local devices. “If you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account.

Can robots tackle late-life loneliness?,"In this era, everyone is busy in his life. No one spares time for someone. so robots tackle life loneliness? We have no time to stand and stare. This causes loneliness. Loneliness is due to fast-moving life and hurry and worry. In the 21st century, everyone is spending most of their time earning money. They are day-by-day transforming into money-earning machines. Due to his perception, we are losing our relations as we can’t give enough time to our families. They are busy earning their livelihood. They never get satisfies and always want more. Everyone is in a race of earning and then sends his children far away from himself to make them well settled in order to maintain their status. But one faces the consequences of this kind of lifestyle in his old age. People usually don’t spend time with their children when their children are in their childhood but they yearn for the company of their children in their old age. They feel lonely but have none to talk with. They are still attached to people, places, belongings, and memorable events from the past, although they understand that life cannot continue the same way as earlier, and this may easily result in feelings of loneliness and social isolation. As they become older, they need to be attended to in order to meet their daily needs. Robots can indeed serve the purpose but they can aid only mechanical care. They are just emotionless, feeling fewer entities. Robots aren’t creative. They can work only according to a pre-programmed system and till now no such software has been created that can transfer human feelings into robots. This is the major loophole of using robots to tackle late-life loneliness. They can undoubtedly serve their masters but their masters can’t share their feelings with them as they are incapable to understand or react to them. They can’t change their activity according to the occasion. They can provide anything except emotional satisfaction and without emotional gratification, loneliness can’t be tackled. A master can be attached to his robot but that attachment is only due to their service. They can’t share their thoughts with them. In this era, we are rendered lonely and in late- life feel the need for a companion with whom we can talk. We feel a need for someone who can listen to us, react, and advise us to tackle our day-to-day life problems. But we can’t find one. We have, undoubtedly, achieved great progress in terms of technology but we can never fill the void in the heart of a person struggling with his late-life loneliness with our advancements. We are in a kind of mental trance in which we experience fame, progress, wealth, etc. but when we gain our consciousness, we find ourselves lonely in this world. Relations in life are actual wealth in a person’s life. We can never enjoy such a bond with a robot. It will follow our commands, take our appropriate care but can’t react to our emotions. It can’t console us. When a man lives in loneliness for a long time, it eats up his conscience and transforms him into a machine. Robots can never become our friends, crack jokes, weep our tears, or establish an emotional connection with us. They can’t understand our feelings. Many people go into depression. Depression or the occurrence of depressive symptoms is a prominent condition amongst older people, with a significant impact on their well-being and quality of life. They remain sick and loneliness directly impacts longevity. Lonely people often think that they are no longer needed in this world and thus they want to die. It impacts their mental, psychological, social, and physical health. Robots prove to be useless in these matters. They can provide motivation, only if they have the software to do so but can’t, themselves, react to such a situation. They don’t know about anger, happiness, or sadness. They don’t themselves bring food when their master is hungry until commanded to do so. They can’t even offer a glass of water themselves. A man living without relations and without fellow feeling no longer remains a human being. He becomes none less than a machine as, due to his loneliness, he becomes mentally ill and goes into a condition like trauma where he no longer enjoys nature’s blessings, becomes happy or sad as he loses the ability to react and hence can’t act. It’s a dangerous situation. We face a plethora of challenges in assisted living facilities such as not being addressed to emotional needs, being neglected, and forcing a withdrawal from social activities. Relations in life, interaction with fellow beings, sharing of joy and happiness, and fellow feeling make a man from mere a ‘being’ to a ‘social being’ and finally a human being."

How you lead a project or a team without any technical expertise?,"So, the answer to the question, which we came across in the first paragraph, is yes and no. Depending upon the position in the hierarchy (yes for a front-line manager and no for a CXO) and the type of the leader you are, the level of technical expertise needed varies. Though as stated earlier by Robert Katz, the CXO’s need to have the least amount of technical expertise, the CXO should know how the technology functions or what are the applications. What processes are to be followed to build the technology.  He or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done, (#itsnothowitswhat). Otherwise, even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but If the leader isn’t aware of that or isn’t learned enough to know what to do with it, no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal. Leaders command respect and don’t demand it and that’s possible when they give value to their front-line employees, seek timely advice from the technical experts, and put the resources to the best of its uses.

Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. The vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan.

How Voice search makes your business a successful business.,"A survey showed that, once a consumer makes a local voice search, their next most common action is to call the business (28%). Customers also are highly likely to visit company websites (27%), show up at the company’s location (19%), and do more research into that business or additional businesses (14% and 12%, respectively). So, in short, while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction, you shouldn’t see it as a total substitute. Many people are going to take further steps after the initial search, and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while. They are going to have more questions, and they’re willing to physically connect with you and what you offer. Don’t drop the ball in other areas, like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, having enough staff ready to chat, listing an accurate contact number, or keeping your store well-stocked. Voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands, but there’s still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business’s bottom line. The next step is to find voice search solutions. However, as with other technologies, these are not necessarily one size fits all, meaning it’s critical to shop around and be specific about your goals. If you can customize and update your options in a scalable way, they’ll be even more effective for your business."
How the COVID-19 crisis is redefining jobs and services?,"To conclude, the companies should understand “Lives come first, but livelihood matters”. The pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services, but this is not the end. The pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations. The companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. The last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services."
How to increase social media engagement for marketers?,"The fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. Social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. Finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. Newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. At the end of the day, ‘customer is indeed king’. And companies would do well to remember it! "

Lessons from the past: Some key learnings relevant to the coronavirus crisis,"I don’t believe that every crisis is the same. Of course, there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see. Even though these are different times, there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences. We cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy, our mental peace, and prevent the spread of the virus. The past has a lot to offer if we ponder. We must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future. Our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work, maintaining employee morale is important and that social. Engagement is imperative. If we use these tools efficiently, we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it."

Due to the COVID-19 the repercussion of the environment,"The crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008. This is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export-based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter-sectoral backward and forward linkage effect, however, the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector. In the present situation, the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non-regulatory authority and out of direct government control. Moreover, lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units, thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like India is becoming weaker. The global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long-lasting. The only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies"
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space and co-working industries.,"COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.  People’s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone’s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost."

Coronavirus: Effect on the Hospitality Industry,"Really this is anyone’s guess. We don’t yet know how long it will take for the epidemic to peak and for us to be allowed out again, but one thing I am sure of is that we’ll all be desperate to meet up with friends over dinner or have a pint in the pub! With proper support from the government I think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly, but perhaps not in its former form. It is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants, leaving space for innovative new entrants. The crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps, if regulation allows, these will stick, becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams. Thus Coronavirus Effect on the Hospitality and other sectors."

Should celebrities be allowed to join politics?,"From our vantage point today, the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay. What remains to be done, however, is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship – to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non-maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve. Yet, it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people – celebrity or not, but in the world that we live in, this is certainly not the case. Politicians – celebrity or not, largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job. Ultimately, like all things in democracy, the government is of the people and its representatives are of them, and for them. The eventual endorsement of its leaders – celebrity or not – can come, not from data-based analyses and elaborate critique, but from the people. Should celebrities be allowed to enter politics? The question remains unanswered. Or rather, is answered by the democratic exercise itself – with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election, when the people – the real ‘influencers’, choose."
How prepared is India to tackle a possible COVID-19 outbreak?,"I am optimistically hoping, based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens, that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today."
How will COVID-19 affect the world of work?,"The coronavirus pandemic is a test. It’s a test of medical capacity and political will. It’s a test of endurance and forbearance, for believers a test of religious faith. It’s a test, too, of a different kind of faith, in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior. The epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence, questions so profound that they have previously been answered, in many different ways, by the greatest philosophers. It’s a test of where all humans stand. What is right and what is wrong? What can individuals expect from society, and what can society expect of them? Should others make sacrifices for me, and vice versa? Is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease? How long will we stay that way? And as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone, we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potent.At last I would like to conclude by saying that COVID-19 is something we all face as a community, and thus something that we have to solve as a community, not with weapons, but with goodwill and common efforts."
Controversy as a Marketing Strategy,"In the end, we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword. On one side, it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses, and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other, it puts the brand value itself at stake. So, it has to be carefully planned, and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires.  Every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution."
Coronavirus: Impact on the Hospitality Industry,"All but five of the 40 occupations in this analysis fall into broad categories that were less likely than the workforce overall to work from home on average in 2018, according to the BLS American Time Use Survey.

At a time when most major cities are urging residents to stay at home and practice social distancing, few jobs are more at risk than these."

What are the key policies that will mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the world of work?,"These are the impacts of COVID-19 on the world of work. Leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices, and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future. R&D teams at one leading high-tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it. Within four weeks, they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline. As China’s workforce begins to return to offices, these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how—with the correct structure, culture, processes, and technology—working remotely can boost productivity and morale. Employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work-life balance are likely to be happier, more motivated, and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations. Embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term. Alibaba launched TaoBao, by now the world’s biggest e-commerce website, while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 SARS outbreak. For Trip.com, an overseas working experiment in 20147 established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture. Hence, bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your company suited the future—whatever which will hold. These are policies that will mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the world of work"

Big Data Analytics in Healthcare,"As data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity. So, the more data we have, the better the outcomes can be obtained. Thus, Big Data technology is clearly the digital disruptor to revolutionize the healthcare sector by consolidating the data from disparate platforms to build a 360-degree view about the human body and help the healthcare provider to generate solutions to life-threatening problems and improved healthcare opportunities."
Business Analytics In The Healthcare Industry,"Combine artificial intelligence with data analysis and machine learning IoT, and it is easy to provide proactive care to patients. Hence, it would be a good move to invest in analytical solutions that can control and mitigate clinical and financial risks, with new payment bundles and models to go with it."
Challenges and Opportunities of Big Data in Healthcare,"In a nutshell, we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics, the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibility."
Obstacles to data-driven Healthcare,"The only way to overcome these challenges is to layout stronger data governance laws, ensure government regulations that do not allow providers to create barriers to exit for the patients and incentivize healthcare providers to adopt digital transformation strategies. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a step in the right direction to protect Patient Health Information (PHI) and mandates providers to set up a compliant infrastructure for threats against security. However, we still have a long way to go before the fears of both the health care providers and patients with electronic modes of capturing data are assuaged and we have better capabilities for capturing relevant data giving the much-needed impetus to analytics in healthcare."
MONETIZATION OF DATA – INNOVATE TO HARVEST THE FULL VALUE OF DATA,"The business of data monetization is likely to evolve
quickly. Payments providers would be well advised to begin planning their
strategy without delay: first-mover advantage may determine future success. A
“start small, scale fast” approach allows for flexibility, learning, and course
correction as the business develops. Partnerships with complementary players in
payments and in the digital and start-up ecosystem could be a winning factor.
How much value could be created is difficult to estimate at this early stage,
but experience in some use cases and markets suggests it could amount to
between 5 and 10 percent of revenues."

Finally, we intend to carry out the final integration of systems engineering and software design in order to establish the desired traceability solution. Our evaluation strategy enables us to carry out a stepwise, incremental validation of our contributions."
Bank Risk Management in India,Technology has to take a central role in risk management to bring operational efficiency. The organization needs to break silos and work as a single unit to discover insights where it needs to improve. Some examples can be:
Advance Analytics for Refocusing Profits,"Taking the first step is the most difficult point for the firm. The firm can take one of the two most common practice approaches. Firstly, firms can create a detailed road map. Then invest in the required capabilities and makes necessary organizational changes accordingly. Secondly, Learning by doing, rapidly creating and prioritizing a long list of use cases specific to the firm. The second case has a higher chance of success for the firm."
Role of big data & analytics in banking and finance,"In spite of tightening regulations, there are financial frauds in companies. As mentioned previously the list of defaulters in the last five years has increased drastically. Tracking the spending patterns of an individual can help to develop stringent regulations for high spending individuals and vice-versa."
Mitigating Bank risk management,"To cope with the above risks, banks need to put more robust and reliable risk management in place. By the end of this decade, or even earlier, the active approach of the financial institutions in handling the risk functions will determine its success or failure. They need a have proactive approach in identifying, assessing and mitigating risk through better IT infrastructure, machine intelligence, better resources allocation/mapping, real-time analytics, and internal control frameworks. However, one can bet that the future will belong to those who will have a go-ahead approach in identifying, assessing and putting effective risk minimization plan to actions."
The Future of Bank Risk Management,"Over the years, banks have been provided with several regulations to create failsafe measures to avoid these risks. However, as banks advance and are trying to get more competitive, it has become imperative that the risks also differs. Banks must become more cautious and adopt new practical methods different from their rudimentary ways to counter them. A good risk management system is one that can support the bank’s abilities to react to short term risk all the while circumventing itself from long term risk that may occur sooner or later. Such efficiency is important because it can devise new operations and talent models to better cover risk without doing irredeemable damage. But it’s not just the system that needs to be efficient but the role professional plays is equally important. There is a need to have better decision-making capabilities that balance the gains with the losses incurred. All in all, a good risk management technique is one that can sense the disruption in technology and can adapt itself in a reliable system to minimize damage both in the short term and in the long term."
How advanced analytics are redefining banking?,
Marketing Analytics – Why do we care about it?,"In the realm of marketing, primary research has traditionally focused on quantitative or qualitative methodologies to provide customer insights. With advances in technology, especially data mining, marketing analytics has become an invaluable tool and should be viewed as an equal component of the marketing research toolkit. Analytics requires marketers to use data to understand customers at every touch point throughout their lifecycle with the business. To do this the analyst must mine, analyze, interpret, and present the information so that it is converted into actionable intelligence. In this process, the customer’s information DNA is tracked, segmented, modeled and then acted upon. As these concepts and tools become standard operating procedures, marketing departments must internalize analytics into their overall curriculum in order to provide Company with a compelling competitive advantage."

Big Data & Analytics to Help Voters Know Their Political Leaders,"Big Data Analytics could be used by rating agencies which could actually launch ratings for politicians and this could be used by the general public in determining how good the leader is. Once the ecosystem is in setup it could be sponsored by the leader itself wherein the party or the leader would want to rate the previous results and personality which if quantified could substantiate their claims in the current scenario. Obviously, the second model would have to be properly audited else it would lose out the credibility. Even the government led organizations could actually keep a track of the election manifestoes of the leaders and then keep a real-time track of the progress of the key developments relating to the subjects in the set agenda."

Impacts of COVID 19 on Food products,"The state has recently announced a stimulus package of INR 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. The intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of INR 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly.
